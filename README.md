# coursera_R
# Crete Script with 2 functions
# The first one, makeCacheMatrix, generates a matrix with the same number of columns
# The second one, cacheSolve, generates the inverse
# The instructions are:
# First compile the program (cachematrix.R)
# Then, execute the first function: v<-makeCacheMatrix(x)
# Finally, you get the inverse matrix: sol<-cacheSolve(v)
